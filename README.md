Algorithms of 2D & 3D Convex Hulls, Distance Maps and Sphere-Polyhedron Collision Detection.

# Part 1

Computed the 2D convex Hull of the 2D Model given. After that a distance map from the convex hull to the object was implemented and stored in specific data structure.
The Distance Map was colored based on the distance calculated.

# Part 2

Computed the 3D Convex Hull of a 3D Model given(Dolphin) and after that create a distance map.
